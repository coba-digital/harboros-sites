# Harbor Mail

**Store your emails securely and on your own terms**: Harbor Mail enables everyday people and privacy enthusiasts alike to host their own email server on their home network. The core mission is to accomplish the following:

## Our Mission

### 1. Privacy-First

We will create a self-hosted platform with end-to-end encryption we will provide a secure method of email communication that puts the privacy and control in the users hands.

### 2. Ease-Of-Use

We will create a seemless experience within a desktop & web GUI that enables everyday people with limited technical abilities to:

- Install the self-hosted program
- Understand and manage connections (endpoints & port forwarding)

### 3. Backups & Redundancy

We will create the following backup services

- Manage or automate regular back ups of data
- An import and export tool to manage data

We will create the following redunant options

- A simple toggle that will enable users to leverage our own cloud services as a redundant endpoint.
  - This feature would not store data on our servers, but would only forward emails to connected client devices
  - An automated notification toggle would allow users to be notified by email, sms message, or client notification when their self-hosted server was not used and an email was sent through the redundant service

### 4. Advanced Controls

We will abstract more advanced controls from the regular user, but enable more tech-savvy individuals to customize their experience with more control

### 5. Provide an API

We will develop an API for interacting with the platform to enable connections with outside tools such as N8N for automation.

## Core Services

The core services will be developed as an open-source solution that is completely free-of-charge. **We will never charge a fee for these services**:

- Providing a downloadable self-hosted email server/client combo for sending, receiving, and storing emails privately.
- Enabling custom endpoints and port management for custom domains and network infrastructure on the self-hosted solution.
- A self-hosted GUI desktop and web application + mobile app for interacting with the service.

## Paid Services

### Cloud Services

#### Cloud Mail

For those who don't want to self-host, but still want the privacy of self-storage and the security of end-to-end encryption.

Users will be able to leverage our web and mobile app clients to send and receive emails while still storing emails locally on their devices (no storage of user data happens on our cloud engine).
