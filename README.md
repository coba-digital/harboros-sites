# Harbor Mail

Harbor OS is a suite of privacy-first, self-hosted applications built for peace of mindâ€”not ad networks. We don't just put control back in your hands, we build easy-to-use systems that keep your data physically separate from big tech. We handle the complexity, you control your data.
